  Alright, my brothers, listen closely  
  Tonight, we make the Trojans pay  
  Ten years of war, they've killed us slowly  
  But now we'll be the ones who slay  
  Think of your wives and your children  
  Your families wonder where you've been  
  They're growing old and yet you're still here  
  Do what I say, and you'll see them again (yes, sir!)  
  Diomedes will lead the charge  
  Agamemnon will flank the guards  
  Menelaus will let our mates  
  Through the gates to take the whole city at large  
  Teucer will shoot any ambush attack  
  And little Ajax will stay back  
  Nestor, secure Helen and protect her  
  Neo, avenge your father, kill the brothers of Hector (yes, sir!)  
  Find that inner strength now (whoo!)  
  Use that well of pride (whoo!)  
  Fight through every pain now (whoo!)  
  Ask yourself inside  
  What do you live for? What do you try for?  
  What do you wish for? What do you fight for?  
  (What do you live for? What do you try for?)  
  (What do you wish for? What do you fight for?)  
  Penelope  
  Penelope  
  And Telemachus  
  I fight for us  
  I fight for us  
  Penelope  
  (What do you try for?) Telemachus  
  (What do you wish for?) I'm on my way  
  (What do you fight for?) Attack!  
  Who was that?  
  A vision  
  Of what is to come, cannot be outrun  
  Can only be dealt with right here and now  
  Tell me how  
  I don't think you're ready  
  A mission to kill someone's son  
  A foe who won't run  
  Unlike anyone you have faced before  
  Say no more  
  I know that I'm ready  
  (I don't think you're ready)  
  It's just an infant  
  It's just a boy  
  What sort of imminent threat does he pose, that I cannot avoid?  
  This is the son of none other than Troy's very own Prince Hector  
  Know that he will grow from a boy to an avenger  
  One fueled with rage as you're consumed by age  
  If you don't end him now, you'll have no one left to save  
  You can say goodbye to (Penelope)  
  You can say goodbye to (Penelope)  
  I could raise him as my own (he will burn your house and throne)  
  Or send him far away from home (he'll find you wherever you go)  
  Make sure his past is never known (the gods will make him know)  
  I'd rather bleed for ya (he's bringing you)  
  Down on my knees for ya  
  I'm begging please (oh, this is the will of the gods)  
  Please don't make me do this, don't make me do this  
  The blood on your hands is something you won't lose  
  All you can choose is whose
