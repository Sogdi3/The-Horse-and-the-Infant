I could raise him as my own (he will burn your house and throne) Or send him far away from home (he'll find you wherever you go) Make sure his past is never known (the gods will make him know) I'd rather bleed for ya (he's bringing you) Down on my knees for ya I'm begging please (oh, this is the will of the gods)
